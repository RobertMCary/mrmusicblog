# mrmusicblog
Blog site working on with a friend. An offshoot of the music database I'd like to eventually incorporate.

I want to include a review section and database section. The review section will allow simple and efficient transport
between different reviews, artists, labels, etc. Would like to allow login so users can join, favorite records,
comment on content, etc.

Database section is still up in the air.
